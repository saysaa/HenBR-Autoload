# HenBR-Autoload
Download any PS4 exploit in one click
_________________________________________


# How does HenBR work?

It uses Python's `requests` function to retrieve the latest GitHub release of the selected exploit.


# Will there be updates?

Yes, of course there will be updates when more exploits are released or if I've forgotten some.


# What's the point of this?

I found finding the source page for PS4 exploits relatively complicated, so I decided to create an automated script that downloads the one I want.


# What do I need to install?

You only need to install Python, then the program will automatically install the required modules (`pip install requests`).

Windows won't let me run `[main.exe]` "for Windows 11"

Windows Security -> App & browser control -> Smart app control settings -> Off

**Alternatively:**

Windows Security -> Virus & threat protection -> Virus & threat protection settings -> Manage settings -> Real-time protection -> Off

If you don't want to disable your antivirus, do this:

Windows Security -> Virus & threat protection -> Exclusions -> Add or remove exclusions -> Then add the HenBR-Autoload folder
